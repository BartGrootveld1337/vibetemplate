-- Seed Data for Development
-- =============================================================================
-- This file is used to populate the database with sample data for development.
-- Run with: supabase db reset (this will apply migrations AND seed data)
--
-- Note: In production, you typically wouldn't run seed data.
-- This is only for local development and testing.
-- =============================================================================

-- Example: Insert sample data here
-- The profiles table is auto-populated when users sign up, so we don't need
-- to seed it directly. But you can add other seed data here.

-- Example of how to seed data:
-- insert into public.some_table (column1, column2)
-- values 
--   ('value1', 'value2'),
--   ('value3', 'value4');

-- For now, this file serves as a placeholder and documentation.
-- Add your development seed data as needed.
